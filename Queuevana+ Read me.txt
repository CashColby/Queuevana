# Queuevana+

> **Status: Under Development / Experimental**

Queuevana+ is an in-development evolution of Queuevana focused on exposing a **deterministic input queue system as a reusable library** rather than a standalone, game-focused tool.

While Queuevana and Queuevana Hold are designed primarily for end-user execution, Queuevana+ is intended to be **integrated into other software, tools, or workflows**.

---

## What Is Queuevana+?

Queuevana+ provides a structured way to capture, queue, and replay input events with strict ordering and optional timing control.

The goal is to make input handling:

* Predictable
* Deterministic
* Decoupled from real-time execution constraints

Queuevana+ is not limited to gaming and is **not a macro or automation framework**.

---

## Design Goals

Queuevana+ is being built around the following principles:

* **Library-first design**
  Intended to be called, embedded, or linked rather than run directly

* **Deterministic behavior**
  Input order is preserved exactly as received

* **Minimal abstraction leakage**
  Clear separation between input capture, scheduling, and execution

* **Low overhead**
  Suitable for long-running or background usage

* **Composable**
  Designed to integrate cleanly with other systems

---

## Intended Use Cases

Queuevana+ is aimed at scenarios where predictable input scheduling is required, including:

* Application-level input handling
* Tooling and utilities that process user input
* Accessibility or assistive workflows
* Testing and simulation environments
* Gaming and non-gaming scenarios where raw input timing is unreliable

It is **not designed specifically for competitive gaming**, nor does it provide automation or gameplay logic.

---

## Current Status

Queuevana+ is **under active development**.

At this stage:

* APIs are not considered stable
* Behavior and structure may change
* Documentation is subject to revision

Breaking changes may occur without notice.

## Relationship to Queuevana

| Project        | Purpose                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Queuevana      | General-purpose input queue (end-user tool) |
| Queuevana Hold | Specialized hold-based variant (niche)      |
| Queuevana+     | Reusable input queue engine (library)       |

Queuevana+ shares the same core philosophy but targets a different audience.

---

## What Queuevana+ Is *Not*

To avoid confusion, Queuevana+:

* Does **not** automate input
* Does **not** generate synthetic actions
* Does **not** bypass application logic
* Does **not** provide macros or scripting layers

It strictly processes **real input events**.

---

## Roadmap (High-Level)

Planned areas of exploration include:

* Clean public API for enqueueing and processing input events
* Configurable timing and scheduling policies
* Modular input sources and sinks
* Optional bindings for different environments

This roadmap is intentionally flexible.

---

## Contributing

Because Queuevana+ is experimental, contributions are welcome in the form of:

* Design discussion
* Architecture feedback
* Edge-case testing

Implementation details may change rapidly.

---

## Disclaimer

Queuevana+ is provided as-is during development.

Use responsibly and ensure compliance with the terms of any software or platform it interacts with.

---

## Closing

Queuevana+ exists to make **input handling boring, predictable, and reliable** — even in environments where timing and ordering are traditionally difficult to control.

As development progresses, documentation and guarantees will evolve accordingly.
